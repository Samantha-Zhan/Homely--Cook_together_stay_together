## Background üçé
With more and more people started to cook at home during the pandemic. There is an emerging trend that more people will come out of quarantine with some cooking skills. 
A convenient app is handy for them to keep up with the good habit and become better mentally and physically.

## Our Mission üçá
Our mission is to make home cooking a ***simple***, ***intuitive***, and ***enjoyable*** thing to do by streamlining the whole proccess: recipe searching, planning, grocery shopping, cooking, enjoy, and repeat! Our idea come from our passion for food and home cooking. With years of cooking experiences, we summarized the problems and inconvenience we faced when we cook. We believe our app, Homely, is a great solution for it.
